# Portfolio

This portfolio is intended to be an in depth look at my skills in web development. 
Presently at the moment, I do not have enough material to put in my portfolio, so it is fill with placeholders.
As I build more skills and complete more projects, I will proactively rebuild and reconstruct it as needed to make it look more professional.
